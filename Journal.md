Made the entire thing.

I started with a digital generator that I made in Python. It was a simple program that generated the spirts for the compass. This was taken from the Minecraft wiki.

then I put these images into a photo editor to see what pixels I needed to be LEDs.

using blending options I can see what pixels I needed to be LEDs.

I choose the XIAO RP2040 as the microcontroller because it was small and cheap.

I then made the PCB. I traced out the compass then I used grid to align the LEDs.
